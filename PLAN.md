## Active Task

- Fix Playwright/Chromium browser mismatch in web sessions — plan in
  `tasks/active--playwright-chromium-mismatch.md`.

## Current Status

- feat: add a custom store from an AI-generated JSON file

## Backlog

### iOS App (Capacitor Shared-Pipeline Wrapper)

- Wrap Shoop as an installable iOS app via a thin Capacitor shell over the same web
  codebase (one repo → one `dist/` → `cap sync`), primarily to close the iOS
  `share_target` gap with a native Share Extension funneling into the existing
  `/import` flow. Multi-phase outline in `tasks/backlog--ios-capacitor-app.md`;
  each phase to be promoted to `active--` and fully planned (with ADR review)
  before implementation.

### Unit Test Audit

- Review unit tests related to components (atoms, molecules, organisms). Ensure that tests do not rely heavily on mocks and that components are small, testable units.

### E2E Audit

- Audit existing E2E tests and harden/expand coverage.

### Sharing

- Users can share their lists with another device/user; need a solution that works with our PWA/IndexedDB only storage tech stack.

### Research Mode

- Need way to populate stores without public aisle/inventories available.
