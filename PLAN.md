## Active Task

- None. Pick up the next backlog item when directed.

## Current Status

- feat: add a custom store from an AI-generated JSON file

## Backlog

### iOS App (Capacitor Shared-Pipeline Wrapper)

- Wrap Shoop as an installable iOS app via a thin Capacitor shell over the same web
  codebase (one repo → one `dist/` → `cap sync`), primarily to close the iOS
  `share_target` gap with a native Share Extension funneling into the existing
  `/import` flow. Multi-phase outline in `tasks/backlog--ios-capacitor-app.md`;
  each phase to be promoted to `active--` and fully planned (with ADR review)
  before implementation.

### Unit Test Audit

- Review unit tests related to components (atoms, molecules, organisms). Ensure that tests do not rely heavily on mocks and that components are small, testable units.

### E2E Audit

- Audit existing E2E tests and harden/expand coverage.

### Fix Playwright/Chromium Browser Mismatch in Web Sessions

- In the Claude Code web execution environment, `npx playwright test` fails with
  `Executable doesn't exist at .../chromium_headless_shell-<N>/...`: the pinned
  `@playwright/test` version expects a newer browser build than the one
  pre-installed under `/opt/pw-browsers` (seen: tool wants build 1228, env has
  1194), and `npx playwright install` is disabled in this environment.
- Current workaround is a throwaway local config overriding
  `launchOptions.executablePath` to the installed binary
  (`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-<N>/chrome-linux/chrome`) — not committed, manual
  each session.
- Goal: make `npm run test:e2e` work out-of-the-box in web sessions without a
  hand-rolled config. Options to evaluate: a SessionStart hook (see the
  `session-start-hook` skill) that resolves the installed Chromium and exports it
  for Playwright; reading `executablePath` from an env var in
  `playwright.config.ts` (defaulting to Playwright's own resolution locally/CI so
  it doesn't regress CI); or aligning the pinned `@playwright/test` version with
  the env's browser build. Confirm CI (which installs its own browsers) is
  unaffected by whatever approach is chosen.

### Sharing

- Users can share their lists with another device/user; need a solution that works with our PWA/IndexedDB only storage tech stack.

### Research Mode

- Need way to populate stores without public aisle/inventories available.
